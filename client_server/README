 -Modify it and run it on a single system.  To do this you might

   2) Run the server in the background like: java TCPServer &
      and use the same window to run the client

 -Modify it to connect to a server on a different system

 -A a try/catch to be able to clean up error messages

 -Put the client in a loop and enhance it with prompts asking for a system
