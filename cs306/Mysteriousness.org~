* Introduction
We were supposed to tackle three different problems and submit three
possible solutions per problem to be evaluated. I assume the point of
this exploration is to help us experience good approaches to comparing
different possible solutions to things we could encounter in the
workplace, and thus prepare us for better problem solving through
algorithm evaluation.

** Problem 1
#+BEGIN_VERSE
//count up and add the rest onto the last num
For 0 ... numPieces - 1
   set pieces of position i to i + i
   
add remainder to last position in pieces

// work from triangular number and count down
For 0 ... numPieces
   set pieces of position i to numPieces - i
   
add remainder to pieces of position 0

// work from average num and adjust
For 0 ... numPieces
   set pieces of position i to average number
   
add remainder to pieces of position 0

set maxPossibleAdjustment to average number - 1
For 2 ... numPieces, increment by 2
   add maxPossibleAdjustment to pieces of position i - 1
   subtract maxPossibleAdjustment from pieces of position i
   subtract 1 from maxPossibleAdjustment
#+END_VERSE

This one was interesting. I started out with a simple approach: start
with one for the first box, increase by one for every box, and then
after I ran out of boxes, I just added the difference on top to ensure
that no numbers would collide by putting the difference in a lower
number.

My second approach was to start at the number of boxes and count down
from there forming a perfect sum (6, 10, 15, 21, etc...), and then to
put the difference in the top number to avoid collisions.

My best approach, I feel, was my last when I decided to divide the
number by the number of boxes and adjust by adding and subtracting
different amounts to get the same total value, but preserve uniqueness
amongst the numbers. It took me a bit to figure out some corner cases,
but I calculated the maximum sequential adjustment I could make and
then counted down my adjustments from there.

I was having fun so I tried some different approaches that didn't get
all worked out. For example, I tried to evenly distribute the distance
of numbers to add up to the total. This proved to be non-trivial to
know where to stop and to ensure uniqueness in regards to the last
number.  If I had more time I would change my second algorithm a bit
so that instead of adding the difference to the top number, I would go
back the appropriate number of boxes and add one to all of them so
that the difference could be adjusted that way.

I was interested in evaluating these algorithms by efficiency, memory
usage, and elegance.

*** Efficiency
In terms of efficiency, all three algorithms performed the same.

*** Memory
As far as memory usage goes, all three algorithms used the same amount. 

*** Elegance
When it comes to elegance, the first two are comparable, and in fact
could be considered variations of each other since they both return
similar results. The third algorithm, however, is much more elegant
than the first two since it returns more interesting numbers.



** Problem 2
#+BEGIN_VERSE
//Brute force

For 1 ... 26
   nested loops for each letter var with same condition
      if checkNumbers is true
         return
	
//Shuffle algorithm

While checkNumbers is false
   assign vars to random numbers from 1 to 26
	
//Brute force vowels and then use linear algebra to solve for consonants

For 1 ... 26
   nested loops for each vowel var with same condition
      set testable to true
      for 0 ... num words
         set remainder to word total modulus word vowels total 
         if remainder is true
            set testable to false
            break
      if testable is true
         set up system of equations using consonants as unknowns and word total divided by vowel total as final column in matrix for each word
         use Gauss-Jordan Elimination Method to reduce matrix 
         if matrix succesfully reduces to reduced row echelon form with no free variables
            if vowels are unique and consonants are unique
               return
#+END_VERSE

This one was a much more difficult problem. It wasn’t particularly
difficult for me to solve, but many of the techniques I used were
non-trivial to code, so I decided to start with a more basic approach:
brute force. I would use loops to go through every single combination
of letter values and test them out on words until I found a
solution. This helped me a bit later on.

My second approach was actually just fun. It was inspired by the
“boggle-sort” method. I would randomly assign each letter to a value
and check for correctness. I would repeat this process until a
solution was found.

My third technique was a hybrid of the brute force method and linear
algebra. The hard part is getting it down into the right factors. I
tried a few approaches, but they were non-trivial. So I decided to use
a brute-force method for the vowels and that would allow me to build a
system of equations with the consonants. I picked vowels for the brute
force part since there are less of them. I just needed a set of vowels
that would evenly divide the words they were assigned to. Once I had
what I called a “testable set”, I could build a system of equations
with the remaining consonants and reduce it with the Gauss-Jordan
Elimination Method. If I got the identity matrix excluding the
solution column, I just had to double check that the vowels contained
no duplicates and the solution column contained no duplicates.

If I had more time, I would work out the factoring bit so that brute
forcing the vowels would be unnecessary. I’d start by getting all the
two-part factors from the word values and compare them with other
words that had the same vowels to figure out which part most likely
represented the vowels. I could break down the numbers from there and
then start plugging in to other words and solving from the two-part
factors until I got a unique set for the vowels that worked with all
the words. Then I would form the systems of equations and see if a
unique solution could be found. Then I would rinse and repeat if
necessary.


*** Efficiency
The second algorithm had the worst performance as far as efficiency is
concerned. The worst case scenario is that is never ends. It also has
the best theoretical best case scenario if it happened to get all the
right values on the first shuffle. The odds of this happening are
almost non-existent.  The first algorithm would be quicker than the
shuffle, but still be less than optimal. The third algorithm would be
far superior to the others in efficiency since the brute-force is
limited to 5 potential values instead of 26. The linear algebra
reduction would take care of the remaining values in a procedural
manner.

*** Memory
With memory usage, all three algorithms would use the same
amount. There would need to be a value to store for each letter.

*** Elegance
In regards to elegance, the third algorithm would be considered the
superior solution. It would have the most lines of code, but the
method is more clever than pure brute force. Shuffling would be
considered the least elegant since it isn’t guaranteed to solve the
problem consistently. It was a fun and creative, albeit not
particularly clever, solution.




** Problem 3
#+BEGIN_VERSE
//Brute Force

While next permutation
	push back permutation of question

While question is not correct
   ask next question in vector of questions
   
   
//Brute force variation

While question is not correct
   ask next permutation of question
	
	
//Monkey
Find monkey
Train monkey in the ways of speech and grammar

While next permutation
   if monkey understands question
      monkey writes permutation of question

While question is not correct
   monkey asks next question in list of questions

//Brother Neff
Kidnap Brother Neff and books

While question is not correct
   destroy book
   ask Brother Neff what question is
   
#+END_VERSE
This one was a head-turning problem.  Not knowing exactly
how the problem was defined, or if we had the right answer, was
particularly challenging. I spent a good amount of time staring at the
numbers and trying to make mathematical or cryptographic connections,
only to determine that I was asking all the wrong kinds of
questions. I’m still not sure what I was supposed to be looking
for. Since I was unsure of the problem size, or how to properly verify
a correct answer, brute force, and “variations thereof” seemed like
natural approaches.

My first algorithm permutes through all possible questions and asks
until the correct question is asked.

My second approach is a variation of the first. All possible questions
are generated, but then a trained monkey will weed out nonsense
phrases by hand and only ask coherent ones. The reason for a monkey
being selected instead of a human for the task is that most humans
would tire of the repetitive nature of the task and probably quit
before finding an appropriate solution. A trained monkey could
eventually get there given the training. Plus, who doesn’t like a
trained monkey?

My third approach would be to kidnap brother Neff and his books. I
could destroy one book at a time until Brother Neff asks me the right
question, and thus I would have the answer, or rather the question.

Using the same criteria to judge these algorithms produced some
interesting results.

*** Efficiency
As far as efficiency is concerned, the first algorithm would take a
very long time. It simply needs to generate a gigantic amount of
possible questions. The second algorithm would take possibly longer
than the first. All permutations still need to be generated plus
there’s the added overhead of running all questions through the monkey
to weed out incoherent sentences. The third algorithm has the possible
best case time since the overhead cost of kidnapping only needs to be
paid a single time, and then the time is a direct result of Brother
Neff’s tolerance for “academic pain”. This is admittedly an unknown
variable, but comes with high confidence. It also has the possible
worst case efficiency scenario that Brother Neff is simply willing to
part with all his books and thus an answer is never reached.

*** Memory
In terms of memory usage, the first algorithm needs the most space to
store all possible questions. A simple variation on this algorithm
would be to ask each question as it was generated and thus never store
any question that was not correct. This would be a simple change, but
would dramatically reduce the necessary storage space. Only memory is
needed for storing the most common words to generate from, but this is
relatively trivial as far as memory goes. The second algorithm would
take up less space than the first if storing all possible questions
since incoherent questions were weeded out, and thus never need be
stored. These incoherent questions would make up the vast majority of
all possible combinations, so the memory required would be
substantially less than the first, assuming the first stored all
possibilities. The third algorithm is probably the most efficient with
storage since the only memory required is that of Brother Neff and his
love for his books.

*** Elegance
In regards to elegance some interesting things happened. The first
algorithm is actually optimal in the fact that it is guaranteed to
arrive at a solution with minimal side effects. Since the answer, or
rather the question, and the process are relatively unknown, brute
force is actually considered an elegant approach. The second algorithm
has an interesting side effect of even if a question is not reached,
the presence of a trained monkey that can actually do grammar problems
could produce an unexpected revenue stream. This does come with a
challenge of actually obtaining and training said monkey. The
difficulty involved in implementation makes this algorithm less than
optimal; especially in consideration of the efficiency drawback
compared to the other algorithms. The third solution was considered
optimal due to the overall unpleasantness for all parties involved,
and the side effect that I would probably be doing jail time whether
or not the proper solution was reached. These factors make this
algorithm come last in terms of elegance.


* Conclusion
While these were not simple problems, the most important problems are
rarely simple. It turns out that sometimes brute force is the best
overall solution. Many times the best solution is not the first one
you had, and should certainly never be the only solution
proposed. Coming up with one solution leads to many variations and
sometimes completely different ones, but exploration is the necessary
path to arrive at a potential optimal solution.

* Acknowledgement
I received Brother Neff's email. I read brother Neff's email. I spent
a lot of time implimenting changes to my report to align with the
instructions in Brother Neff's email. Things that needed correction
after class today were to use verse tags instead of source tags for
pseudocode and replacing my actual C++ source code with higher level pseudocode since "high-level only" was a
request made in Brother Neff's email. These changes have now been
implimented and the export has been tested. Thank you Brother Neff.
