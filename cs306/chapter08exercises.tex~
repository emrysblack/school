Exercise 9 on page 292 - ``efficiciencies'' should be ``efficiencies''
\section*{Solution to Exercise 9 on page 292}
\label{sec-3}


I would use Pascal's Triangle to get around the multiplications. I can
generate the triangle up to the n$^{\mathrm{th}}$ row and simply select the k$^{\mathrm{th}}$
item as my coefficient.

The time efficiency is much better than the formula method since
addition is much cheaper than the multiplication, or factorials,
required in the formula.

At first glance, it may seem that the space efficiency is bad since we
have to store Pascal's Triangle, but if we consider than we only ever
need to store two rows of the triangle (for computing to the next row
from the previous), the cost isn't that bad. The cost will only be
seen for large values of n and is well worth the price for the incredible
gain in time efficiency in most cases.

\emph{World Series odds}

Consider two teams, \emph{A} and \emph{B}, playing a series of games until one
of the teams wins \emph{n} games. Assume that the probability of \emph{A}
winning a games is the same for each game and equal to \emph{p}, and the
probability of \emph{A} losing a game is \emph{q = 1 - p}. (Hence, there are
no ties.)  Let \emph{P(i, j)} be the probability of \emph{A} winning a series
of games if \emph{A} needs \emph{i} more games to win the series and \emph{B} needs
\emph{j} more games to win the series.

\textbf{a.} P(i,j) = P(i-1,j) + P(i,j-1), the first recurrence is the
probability of Team A winning the game. This leaves one less game for
them to win and Team B still needs the same amount. The second
recurrence is the opposite where Team A loses and has to win the same
amount of games, but Team B has one less game to win.

\textbf{b.} Find the probability of team \emph{A} winning a seven-game series if
     the probability of the team winning a game is 0.4.

\textbf{c.} Write pseudocode of the dynamic programming algorithm for
     solving this problem and determine its time and space
     efficiencies.

\section*{Exercise 8 on page 297 (NOTE wording change: Give two reasons versus Explain)}
\label{sec-5}


Give two reasons why the memory function approach is unattractive
for the problem of computing a binomial coefficient by the formula
\emph{C(n, k) = C(n - 1, k - 1) + C(n - 1, k)}.

\section*{Exercise 5 on page 303}
\label{sec-6}


True or false: The root of an optimal binary search tree always contains
the key with the highest search probability.

\section*{Exercise 7 on page 312}
\label{sec-7}


Solve the all-pairs shortest-path problem for the digraph with the
weight matrix

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
  0 &  2 &  \infty &  1 &  8 \\
  6 &  0 &  3 &  2 &  \infty \\
  \infty &  \infty &  0 &  4 &  \infty \\
  \infty &  \infty &  2 &  0 &  3 \\
  3 &  \infty &  \infty &  \infty &  0 \\
  \end{array}\right]\]
