* Exercise 9 on page 292

/Binomial coefficient/

Design an efficient algorithm for computing the binomial coefficient
/C(n, k)/ that uses no multiplications. What are the time and space
efficiciencies of your algorithm?

* Exercise 12 on page 292

/World Series odds/

Consider two teams, /A/ and /B/, playing a series of games until one
of the teams wins /n/ games. Assume that the probability of /A/
winning a games is the same for each game and equal to /p/, and the
probability of /A/ losing a game is /q = 1 - p/. (Hence, there are
no ties.)  Let /P(i, j)/ be the probability of /A/ winning a series
of games if /A/ needs /i/ more games to win the series and /B/ needs
/j/ more games to win the series.

*a.* Set up a recurrence relation for /P(i, j)/ that can be used by
     a dynamic programming algorithm.

*b.* Find the probability of team /A/ winning a seven-game series if
     the probability of the team winning a game is 0.4.

*c.* Write pseudocode of the dynamic programming algorithm for
     solving this problem and determine its time and space
     efficiencies.

* Exercise 8 on page 297 (NOTE wording change: Give two reasons versus Explain)

Give two reasons why the memory function approach is unattractive
for the problem of computing a binomial coefficient by the formula
/C(n, k) = C(n - 1, k - 1) + C(n - 1, k)/.

* Exercise 5 on page 303

True or false: The root of an optimal binary search tree always contains
the key with the highest search probability.

* Exercise 7 on page 312

Solve the all-pairs shortest-path problem for the digraph with the
weight matrix

\[\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
  0 &  2 &  \infty &  1 &  8 \\
  6 &  0 &  3 &  2 &  \infty \\
  \infty &  \infty &  0 &  4 &  \infty \\
  \infty &  \infty &  2 &  0 &  3 \\
  3 &  \infty &  \infty &  \infty &  0 \\
  \end{array}\right]\]
