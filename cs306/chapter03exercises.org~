* Exercise 2 on page 106

As shown in Section 2.1, the average number of key comparisons made
by sequential search (without a sentinel, under standard assumptions
about its inputs) is given by the formula

\[C_{avg}(n) = \frac{p(n + 1)}{2} + n(1 - p),\]

where /p/ is the probability of a successful search. Determine, for
a fixed /n/, the values of /p/ \((0 \le p \le 1)\) for which this
formula yields the maximum value of \(C_{avg}(n)\) and the minimum
value of \(C_{avg}(n)\).

* Exercise 11 on pages 121-122

/Famous alphametic/

A puzzle in which the digits in a correct mathematical expression,
such as a sum, are replaced by letters is called /*cryptarithm*/;
if, in addition, the puzzle’s words make sense, it is said to be an
/*alphametic*/. The most well-known alphametic was published by the
renowned British puzzlist Henry E. Dudeney (1857–1930):

|   | S | E | N | D |
| + | M | O | R | E |

| M | O | N | E | Y |

Two conditions are assumed: first, the correspondence between
letters and decimal digits is one-to-one, i.e., each letter
represents one digit only and different letters represent different
digits. Second, the digit zero does not appear as the left-most
digit in any of the numbers. To solve an alphametic means to find
which digit each letter represents. Note that a solution’s
uniqueness cannot be assumed and has to be verified by the solver.

*a.* Write a program for solving cryptarithms by exhaustive
search. Assume that a given cryptarithm is a sum of two words.

*b.* Solve Dudeney’s puzzle the way it was expected to be solved when
it was first published in 1924.
