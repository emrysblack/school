* Exercise 3 on page 313

Consider the problem of scheduling /n/ jobs of known
durations \(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n\) for execution by a single
processor. The jobs can be scheduled in any order, one job at a
time. You want to find a shedule that minimizes the total time
spent by all the jobs in the system. (The time spent by one job in
the system is the sum of the time spent by this job in waiting plus
the time spent on its execution.)  Design a greedy algorithm for
this problem. Does the greedy algorithm always yield an optimal
solution?
