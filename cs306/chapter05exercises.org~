* Exercise 1 on page 174

*a.* Write a pseudocode for a divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding
a position of the largest element in an array of /n/ numbers.

*b.* What will be your algorithm's output for arrays with several
elements of the largest value?

*c.* Set up and solve a recurrence relation for the number of key
comparisons made by your algorithm.

*d.* How does this algorithm compare with the brute-force algorithm
for this problem?

* Exercise 5 on page 175

Find the order of growth for solutions of the following recurrences.

*a.* \(T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n, T(1) = 1\)

*b.* \(T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2, T(1) = 1\)

*c.* \(T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^3, T(1) = 1\)

*NOTE:* No exercises are assigned for the remaining sections 5.2-5.5.
