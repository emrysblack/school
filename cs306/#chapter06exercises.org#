* Exercise 1 on page 216

Solve the following system by Gaussian Elimination:

| x_1 + x_2 + x_3  | = | 2 |
| 2x_1 + x_2 + x_3 | = | 3 |
| x_1 - x_2 + 3x_3 | = | 8 |

/Up to 10 points are possible for a correct answer with a good analysis./

** Solution

| 1 | 1 | 1 | = | 2 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | = | 3 |  
| 1 | -1 | 3 | = | 8 |


| 1 | 1 | 1 | = | 2 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | = | 1 |  
| 2 | 0 | 4 | = | 10 |


| 1 | 0 | 0 | = | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | = | 2 |  
| 0 | 0 | 4 | = | 8 |


| 1 | 0 | 0 | = | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | = | 1 |  
| 0 | 0 | 1 | = | 2 |


| 1 | 0 | 0 | = | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | = | -1 |  
| 0 | 0 | 1 | = | 2 |


| x_1 = 1 | x_2 = -1 | x_3 = 2 |

* Exercise 2 on page 216

*a.* Solve the system of the previous question by the /LU/ decomposition method.

*b.* From the standpoint of general algorithm design techniques, how would
     you classify the /LU/ decomposition method?

/Up to 10 points are possible for a correct answer with all the steps shown for part *a*./

/Up to 2 points are possible for a correct answer, well explained, for part *b*./

** Solution
*** a
*** b
Transform and Conquer - We are not reducing
* Exercise 3 on page 216

Solve the system of Problem 1 by computing the inverse of its
coefficient matrix and then multiplying it by the right-hand side
vector.

/Up to 10 points are possible for a correct answer with all the steps shown./
