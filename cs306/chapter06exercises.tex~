\section*{Exercise 1 on page 216}
\label{sec-1}


Solve the following system by Gaussian Elimination:


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llr}
 x$_1$ + x$_2$ + x$_3$   &  =  &  2  \\
 2x$_1$ + x$_2$ + x$_3$  &  =  &  3  \\
 x$_1$ - x$_2$ + 3x$_3$  &  =  &  8  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\emph{Up to 10 points are possible for a correct answer with a good analysis.}

\subsection*{Solution}
\label{sec-1.1}

\begin{bmatrix}
    1       & 1 & 1 & \dots & 2 \\
    2       & 1 & 1 & \dots & 3 \\
    1       & -1 & 3 & \dots & 8
\end{bmatrix}

\section*{Exercise 2 on page 216}
\label{sec-2}


\textbf{a.} Solve the system of the previous question by the \emph{LU} decomposition method.

\textbf{b.} From the standpoint of general algorithm design techniques, how would
     you classify the \emph{LU} decomposition method?

\emph{Up to 10 points are possible for a correct answer with all the steps shown for part *a*.}

\emph{Up to 2 points are possible for a correct answer, well explained, for part *b*.}

\section*{Exercise 3 on page 216}
\label{sec-3}


Solve the system of Problem 1 by computing the inverse of its
coefficient matrix and then multiplying it by the right-hand side
vector.

\emph{Up to 10 points are possible for a correct answer with all the steps shown.}

\section*{Bonus Exercises}
\label{sec-4}


\emph{Up to 30 bonus points are possible for good answers, well explained, for Exercises 4, 5 and 6 on page 206.}
